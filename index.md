We will be launching in Boston University's [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://www.bu.edu/psych/) in July 2025.

Research in the lab will focus on understanding developmental changes in value-guided learning, memory, and exploration from childhood to early adulthood.

 The statistics of the environments we experience — including the frequency with which we encounter particular states, the prevalence of reward, and the volatility of action-outcome contingencies — determine how we should explore and learn, and what information we should remember. Across development, how do we flexibly adapt our learning processes to the demands of varied contexts? How do we learn about the structure of the environment and then use that structural knowledge to guide subsequent learning and decision-making? How do we learn to learn over multiple timescales of experience? We will use behavioral studies, computational modeling, and fMRI to address questions about how and why learning processes change over time and through experience, and what the consequences of those changes are for goal-directed behavior.
