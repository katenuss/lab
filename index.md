<br>
We are part of the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/), the [Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory](https://cnlm.uci.edu/), and the [Center for Theoretical Behavioral Sciences](https://www.ctbs.socsci.uci.edu/). We also collaborate with the [UCI Conte Center on Unpredictable Early-Life Experience](https://contecenter.uci.edu/).

Our research asks the question: Why do humans make the choices that we do? We are particularly interested in the roles that various kinds of memories -- long-term, episodic and semantic memories -- serve in allowing people to plan 
for the future and make sense of the present, and how the use of memory in decision-making shapes what we remember, and when these memories come to mind. Ongoing projects investigate the use of memory in decisions for reward, 
perceptual inference, substance use, and planning, using computational model-driven analysis of behavior and brain activity.
