description: "Briana Coleman finished her Bachelors degree in 2022!

She was a Campuswide Honors undergraduate student in Dr. Bornsteinâ€™s lab at the University of California, Irvine.
Her interests lie in learning how anxiety can affect an individual's decision-making, and how this relationship is modulated by socioeconomic and demographic factors.

Outside the lab, Briana enjoys reading books and training in Mixed Martial Arts including Muay Thai, Kickboxing, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu."
