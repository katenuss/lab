description: "Tommie received his Bachelor of Science degree in Cognitive Sciences, with Honors, at the University of California, Irvine. His research interests are in the domain of memory and decision-making. More specifically, he wants to learn how people use their memory to represent the structure of their environments, and how they use that structure to guide their decisions. In his free time, Tommie enjoys the outdoors, plays and follows basketball, and builds custom keyboards.Â  You can catch him hiking with his dog Milo or rooting for his favorite NBA team (go Lakers!)."
