description: "Ari obtained a B.S. in Psychology with a second major in Philosophy from Boston College, where they researched episodic memory with [Maureen Ritchey](http://www.thememolab.org/). Then, they moved to Duke University, where they researched counterfactual thinking with [Felipe De Brigard](https://imclab.org) and worked as Program Coordinator for the [Summer Seminars in Neuroscience and Philosophy](https://ssnap.net). At UCI, Ari is jointly advised by Aaron Bornstein and [Megan Peters](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/cnclab/). Their research uses computational modeling and neuroimaging to characterize the effects of long-term memory on perceptual decisions, with a focus on how subjective confidence in each evidence source modulates their integration. 

Outside of lab, Ari enjoys spending time in nature, hanging out with their cat, and daydreaming about (nearby) possible worlds."
