description: "Brianna Sarcos graduated from UC Irvine in 2020 with a major in Psychology and minor in Biological Sciences. 
She then worked as a post-bac research assistant at Yale Medical School, and will begin her PhD in Clinical Psychology at Temple University in Fall 2023.

She is interested in examining the impact of early life adversity on neurocognitive development to promote engagement in maladaptive behaviors.

She has a specific interest in exposure to violence the ways in which it alters neurocognitive processes (e.g, emotion regulation, learning, and memory) to 
result in violent/aggressive behaviors. In her free time, Brianna enjoys watching True Crime, traveling, and hanging out with her dog, Pork Chop."
