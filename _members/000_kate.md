description: "Kate is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Boston University. She is interested in understanding how learning, memory, and decision-making systems change and shape adaptive behavior across development.

Kate is originally from the Boston area and gradually traveled down the east coast to complete her bachelor's degree at Brown University, her Ph.D. at NYU, and postdoctoral training at Princeton (with a brief stint at Oxford for her masters), before returning back to her home state to launch the lab.


Outside of work, she enjoys traveling, trying new restaurants, and indiscriminately watching TV."
