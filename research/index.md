# Our research
Research in the lab focuses on understanding developmental changes in value-guided learning, memory, and exploration from childhood to early adulthood. We use behavioral studies, computational modeling, and fMRI to address questions about how and why learning processes change over time and through experience, and what the consequences of those changes are for goal-directed behavior.
