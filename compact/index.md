# Lab philosophy
----
<i> drafted on 8/1/2024; subject to change and input as the lab grows </i>

----
Our lab aims to conduct ambitious, open, and rigorous science that gradually uncovers fundamental truths about the development of the brain and the behavior it supports. We view this as a fun and collaborative undertaking, and one in which 'success' is measured not just by the quality of the science we produce, but by the intellectual growth and general state of wellbeing of all lab members. We try to take our science seriously without taking ourselves too seriously.

The opportunity to engage in scientific discovery is a privilege that should be available to everyone committed to making the most of it, regardless of their identities, backgrounds, or opportunities to date. As a lab we will strive to be inclusive, welcoming, and open to diverse perspectives.
