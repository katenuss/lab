<h1>Participate in our research!</h1>
<br/>

Our research asks the question: Why do humans make the choices that we do? We are particularly interested in the roles that various kinds of memories – long-term, episodic and semantic 
memories – serve in allowing people to plan for the future and make sense of the present, how the use of memory in decision-making shapes what we remember, and when these memories come to 
mind. Ongoing projects investigate the use of memory in decisions for reward, perceptual inference, and planning, using computational model-driven analysis of behavior and brain activity.

Here is some more information about the specifics of this study. The first session will take approximately <b>1-2 hours</b>, and will involve a cognitive test battery that looks at measures 
such as reaction time, memory, verbal fluency, etc.
This first session will allow us to create a cognitive profile for your file and we will add you to our participant database so that we can contact you when there are specific experiments that you qualify for.
You will be compensated $20 per hour of your time.

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

Based on your cognitive profile, you may be contacted in the future and asked to participate in some of our additional research studies in our lab at UCI.
For some of our studies, you will get to play games on a computer.
For example, you might play a game to see how well you can remember pictures you saw on the computer screen.
Others may involve answering survey questions or 
doing some learning and decision-making tasks on the computer.
These experiment sessions typically take 1-2 hours per session.

To move forward, it would really help if we could get some information from you. Please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/bYZ2ZuhoKSQgzaah8">this intake form</a>.
We will follow up with our appointment calendar.

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

After you complete the form, we will follow up reading parking, directions to the lab, and additional details.
Thank you again for your interest, and please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns!
